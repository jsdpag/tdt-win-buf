Standard Gizmo controls that any user windowed buffer requires.

 1) BuffSize - Buffer size in MC samples.
 2) ChanPerSamp - Buffer elements per MC sample.
 3) DownSamp - Number of samples (parent device rate) per write to buffer.
 4) BitsPerVal - Number of bits per value. If < 32, indicates compression.
 5) ScaleFactor - Scaling factor applied to values before buffering.
 6) BuffSizeMC - Total buffer size, in elements.
 7) RespWin - Duration of response window timer, in samples at parent device rate.
 8) StartBuff - Reset buffer and resume buffering.
 9) Mindex - Minutes buffer index.
10) Sindex - Seconds buffer index.
11) MCindex - Elements containing buffered MC samples.
12) Counter - Total number of buffered MC samples since Reset.
13) EventMin - Minutes value at StrobeIn rising.
14) EventSec - Seconds value at StrobeIn rising.
