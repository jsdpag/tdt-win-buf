Standard Gizmo controls that any user windowed buffer requires.

 1) BuffSize - Buffer size in MC samples.
 2) ChanPerSamp - Buffer elements per MC sample.
 3) DownSamp - Number of samples (parent device rate) per write to buffer.
 4) BitsPerVal - Number of bits per value. If < 32, indicates compression.
 5) ScaleFactor - Scaling factor applied to values before compressing.
 6) CompDomain - Compression domain. 0: no comp, 1: channels, 2: time.
 7) BuffSizeMC - Total buffer size, in elements.
 8) RespWin - Duration of response window timer, in samples at parent device rate.
 9) StartBuff - Reset buffer and resume buffering.
10) Mindex - Minutes buffer index.
11) Sindex - Seconds buffer index.
12) MCindex - Elements containing buffered MC samples.
13) Counter - Total number of buffered MC samples since Reset.
14) EventMin - Minutes value at StrobeIn rising.
15) EventSec - Seconds value at StrobeIn rising.

Array parameters
  i. Minutes - 'Minutes' time stamp for each sample in MCsamples.
 ii. Seconds - 'Seconds' time stamp for each sample in MCsamples.
iii. MCsamples - Sampled data e.g. spikes or LFPs. 4 or more values per sample.
